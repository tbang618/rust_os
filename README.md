# README
**Note**: The project in the current state does not build.

This current guide uses the crate `bootimage` - I'm going to try to update it to use either `bootloader` or `uefi-rs`.

Based on [https://os.phil-opp.com/] and [https://wiki.osdev.org/Rust_Bare_Bones] and [https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/bare-metal.html].
